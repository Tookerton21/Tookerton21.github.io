      <description>I am currently working on improving and translating my C++ 1050 Led and Kinect project onto a Rust platform. The Pickathon program was a huge success we ran it longer than intended and our display drew way more intention than I ever expected. Now I want to optimize it so that it can run efficiently on a Raspberry Pi. Instead of taking pixels from an OpenGl image, I will be directly taking the pixels out of the RGB data from the depth sensor.</description>
