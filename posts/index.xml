      <description>Update 11.19.18 I just added an arduino uno to the project as a slave to the pi to control the relay module. It is communicating via usb at the moment and just sending it signals, to open and close relays. Just finished writing and testing code written for the pi and arduino to communicate along with testing it.
Auto Grow I currently have the software for the moisture sensor, temp &amp;amp; humidity sensor, and the relays (pump, heater).</description>

      <description>My new project for the winter I have wanted to build an automated grow tent/room for some time. Such a thing would allow me to leave my home days at a time, or even weeks with the reassurance that my plants will be fine. I will be using a Rasberry pi 3, appropriate sensors, stepper motors, paristalic pumps and Relays. I will be implementing this project in C++. I have a bit more information on my Projects page along with my project files.</description>

      <title>Improving Pickathon Project</title>

      <description>I am currently working on improving and translating my C++ 1050 Led and Kinect project onto a Rust platform. The Pickathon program was a huge success we ran it longer than intended and our display drew way more intention than I ever expected. Now I want to optimize it so that it can run efficiently on a Raspberry Pi. Instead of taking pixels from an OpenGl image, I will be directly taking the pixels out of the RGB data from the depth sensor.</description>

      <description>This is my custom one stop shop to find out all of the latest and greatest of my program happenings and maybe get to know me a little bit along the way. Drop me a line at any time if you have questions or if you just want to say “hi”.</description>
